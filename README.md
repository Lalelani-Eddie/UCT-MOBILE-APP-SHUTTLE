### README: UCT Shuttle App Redesign

#### Project Overview
This project involves the redesign of the UCT Shuttle feature within the University of Cape Town (UCT) Mobile App. The redesign aims to enhance the accessibility, personalization, and usability of the app for students and staff. The redesigned app provides two primary features:
1. **Offline Schedule Access** – Users can download shuttle schedules for offline viewing.
2. **Personalized Shuttle Routes** – Frequent shuttle routes are prominently displayed based on user behavior.

#### Key Files
- **NNXLAL001_MDD.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation documenting the evaluation of the current UCT Shuttle app and providing a detailed overview of the redesigned interface, with justifications for key design decisions.
- **Links to User Feedback**:
   - Survey results: [Survey Results on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U3y77D_4DH1wJSKIha8JQWr-ZgmKbrpOeJQ4sD3qiU4/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Survey form: [Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15gbLvZ5WIJOSiHx5iHWnzEEQA-u9Rn0Ee3IP7CavonE/edit#responses)
- **Figma Design**: The final redesigned app is hosted on Figma. [View UCT Shuttle App Redesign on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/8NiZajGhOJflBCIK0DdBwX/UCT-MOBILE-APP?node-id=16-108&t=BNopCKH38rp2wSOr-1)

#### Redesign Goals
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that users can access the shuttle schedule without needing an internet connection, especially at shuttle stops where Wi-Fi is unavailable.
- **Personalization**: Provide a more efficient user experience by displaying frequently used shuttle routes based on individual user behavior, reducing the time required to find relevant information.
- **Efficiency**: Create a cleaner, easier-to-use interface that addresses key flaws identified during user feedback sessions.

#### Features
1. **Offline Schedule Access**:
   - Users can download shuttle schedules for offline access, ensuring that they can view schedules even without data or Wi-Fi. 
   - Schedules can be updated when the user is online.
   
2. **Personalized Shuttle Routes**:
   - Displays the four most frequently used shuttle routes for each user on the home screen. This feature helps users quickly access relevant information without navigating through the app.

#### Justification for the Redesign
The redesign of the UCT Shuttle app was driven by user feedback, highlighting issues such as:
- The inability to access the app without an internet connection.
- The need for more personalized and efficient navigation, particularly for frequent shuttle riders.

By implementing offline access and personalized route features, the redesign prioritizes user accessibility, efficiency, and convenience.

#### How to Use the Redesign
1. **Offline Access**:
   - Users can navigate to the Shuttle section of the app and download the current shuttle schedule for offline use.
   - The schedule remains available until the user chooses to update it online.

2. **Personalized Tiles**:
   - The most frequently used shuttle routes are displayed prominently based on individual usage history, allowing quick access from the main screen.

#### Feedback
Feedback was collected from church mates who frequently use the UCT shuttle after evening services. The survey and feedback form links provide insights into how the redesign can meet user needs and address current app shortcomings.
